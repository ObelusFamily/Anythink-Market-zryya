## First setup

**[TODO 05/01/2018 @vanessa-cooper]:** _It's been a while since anyone ran a fresh copy of this repo. I think it's worth documenting the steps needed to install and run the repo on a new machine?_

Run docker -v and docker-compose -v on terminal to check version  
Then, run docker-compose up from the project root directory  
Point your browser to http://localhost:3000/api/ping
